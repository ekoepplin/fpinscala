This repository is a copy of https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala containing exercises, tests, hints, and answers for the book
[Functional Programming in Scala](http://manning.com/bjarnason/). Along
with the book itself, it's the closest you'll get to having your own
private functional programming tutor without actually having one.
